An API starter testing framework that follows clean and maintainable design principles. 
The framework is created to showcase how to hide lower level technical details of interacting with an API in the core layer of the framework. 
This allows testers with less technical experience to focus on purely asserting the expected values in the test layer of the framework by interacting with the interfaces of the core to invoke the desired endpoints.
